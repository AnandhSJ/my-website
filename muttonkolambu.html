    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>500g mutton, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil or ghee</li>
        <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>2 green chilies, slit lengthwise</li>
        <li>A handful of curry leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coriander powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Small lemon-sized ball of tamarind, soaked in water and pulp extracted</li>
        <li>Water as needed</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander leaves, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Direction</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil or ghee in a large pot or pressure cooker over medium heat. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and fennel seeds. Allow them to splutter.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and slit green chilies. Sauté for a couple of minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
        <li>Add curry leaves and chopped tomatoes. Cook until the tomatoes turn mushy</li>
        <li>Now, add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and garam masala powder. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes until the spices are fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the mutton pieces to the pot and mix them well with the masala. Cook for a few minutes until the mutton pieces are slightly browned</li>
        <li>Pour in enough water to cover the mutton pieces. Add salt to taste. If using a pressure cooker, cover the cooker with its lid and cook for about 4-5 whistles or until the mutton is tender. If using a pot, cover it with a lid and cook until the mutton is tender, stirring occasionally and adding more water if necessary.</li>
        <li>Once the mutton is cooked, add the tamarind pulp (strained if you prefer it without fibers). Stir well and let it simmer for another 5-10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <liAdjust the consistency of the kolambu by adding more water if it's too thick or simmering uncovered to thicken it if it's too thin.></li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped fresh coriander leaves and serve hot with steamed rice or any Indian bread like chapati or dosa.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <p>Spice Balance: Achieving the right balance of spices is crucial for a flavorful Mutton Kolambu. Adjust the quantities of spices like red chili powder, coriander powder, and garam masala according to your taste preferences. Remember that you can always add more spice but can't remove it, so start with less and adjust as needed.</p>
    <p>Tenderizing the Meat: Mutton can be tough, so it's essential to tenderize it properly. Marinate the mutton in yogurt or a mixture of spices and acidic ingredients like tamarind or lemon juice for a few hours before cooking. Alternatively, pressure cooking the mutton can also help tenderize it faster.</p>
    <p>Layered Flavors: Building layers of flavor is key to a delicious Mutton Kolambu. Start by sautéing onions, tomatoes, and spices until they release their aromas. Then add the marinated mutton and allow it to cook in the flavorful base. Finally, finish with a splash of tamarind pulp or lemon juice to brighten the flavors and balance the richness of the dish. Don't forget to garnish with fresh coriander leaves for a burst of freshness.   </p>
