        <li>1 cup yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons coriander powder</li>

        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups basmati rice, soaked for 30 minutes and drained</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>2-3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>4-5 green cardamom pods</li>
        <li>4-5 cloves </li>
        <li>salt you neede</li>
        <li>2 onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li
        <li>2 green chilies, slit lengthwise</li>
        <li>A handful of mint leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>A handful of coriander leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ghee or oil</li>
        <li>Saffron strands soaked in warm milk (optional)</li>
        <li>Fried onions for garnish (optional)</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the mutton: In a bowl, mix together yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and salt. Add the mutton pieces and coat them well with the marinade. Cover and let it marinate for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator, or preferably overnight for best results.</li>
        <li>Cook the rice: In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add soaked and drained basmati rice along with bay leaves, cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, and salt. Cook the rice until it's about 70% done (it should still have a slight bite). Drain the rice and set aside. </li>
        <li>In a heavy-bottomed pan or pressure cooker, heat ghee or oil over medium heat. Add thinly sliced onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove half of the fried onions and set aside for garnish. </li>
        <li>Add chopped tomatoes and slit green chilies to the remaining onions in the pan. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and mushy.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated mutton along with its marinade to the pan. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mutton is partially cooked and the masala is fragrant.</li>
        <li>Layering the biryani: In a heavy-bottomed pot or a pressure cooker, spread a layer of cooked rice evenly at the bottom. Top it with a layer of the partially cooked mutton masala. Sprinkle chopped mint leaves and coriander leaves over the mutton layer. Repeat the layers until all the rice and mutton masala are used up, ending with a layer of rice on top. </li>
        <li>If using saffron, drizzle the saffron-infused milk over the top layer of rice. Cover the pot tightly with a lid.</li>
        <li>Cook the biryani: If using a pot, place it on a tawa (griddle) and cook on low heat for about 25-30 minutes, or until the mutton is tender and the rice is fully cooked. If using a pressure cooker, cook on low heat for about 15-20 minutes after the pressure builds up.</li>
        <li>Once done, remove the biryani from heat and let it rest for a few minutes. Garnish with the reserved fried onions before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve the Mutton Biryani hot with raita (yogurt sauce) or any side dish of your choice.  </li>
        
    </ol>
    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <p>Marination is Key: Marinate the mutton pieces in yogurt and a blend of spices for several hours or overnight. This not only tenderizes the meat but also infuses it with rich flavors, ensuring every bite of your biryani is packed with taste.</p>
    <p>Layering for Flavor: Layering is crucial in biryani-making. Alternate layers of partially cooked rice and marinated mutton in a heavy-bottomed pot or pressure cooker. Intersperse each layer with fresh herbs like mint and coriander to enhance the aroma and taste</p>
    <p>Low and Slow Cooking: Cook the biryani on low heat, allowing the flavors to meld together and the meat to become tender without losing its moisture. Whether on a stovetop or in a pressure cooker, a slow and steady cooking process ensures a perfectly cooked and flavorful Mutton Biryani.</p>
