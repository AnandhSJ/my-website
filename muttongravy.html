    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>500g mutton, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil or ghee</li>
        <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>2 green chilies, slit lengthwise</li>
        <li>A handful of curry leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coriander powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Water as needed</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander leaves, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Direction</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil or ghee in a large pot or pressure cooker over medium heat. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and fennel seeds. Allow them to splutter.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and slit green chilies. Sauté for a couple of minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
        <li>Add curry leaves and chopped tomatoes. Cook until the tomatoes turn mushy.</li>
        <li>Now, add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and garam masala powder. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes until the spices are fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the mutton pieces to the pot and mix them well with the masala. Cook for a few minutes until the mutton pieces are slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Pour in enough water to cover the mutton pieces. Add salt to taste. If using a pressure cooker, cover the cooker with its lid and cook for about 4-5 whistles or until the mutton is tender. If using a pot, cover it with a lid and cook until the mutton is tender, stirring occasionally and adding more water if necessary.</li>
        <li>Once the mutton is cooked, check the consistency of the gravy. If it's too thick, add more water to achieve the desired consistency. Adjust the seasoning if needed.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped fresh coriander leaves and serve hot with steamed rice, naan, or any Indian bread of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <p>Low and Slow Cooking: Mutton benefits from slow cooking to ensure it becomes tender and flavorful. Whether using a pressure cooker or a pot, simmer the mutton on low heat for a longer duration. This allows the meat to absorb the spices and develop rich flavors, resulting in a delicious gravy.</p>
    <p>Layered Aromatics: Building layers of aromatics enhances the depth of flavor in mutton gravy. Start by sautéing onions until golden brown, then add ginger-garlic paste and green chilies for a fragrant base. Incorporate tomatoes for sweetness and acidity, along with a blend of spices like turmeric, chili powder, coriander powder, and garam masala. The gradual addition of these ingredients at different stages ensures a well-balanced and aromatic gravy.</p>
    <p>Balancing the Consistency: Achieving the right consistency is essential for mutton gravy. As the meat cooks, it releases juices that contribute to the gravy. Adjust the amount of water added during cooking to control the thickness of the gravy. Additionally, allow the gravy to simmer uncovered for a while towards the end of cooking to thicken and intensify the flavors. This step also allows you to adjust the seasoning and spice level according to your preference.    </p>
